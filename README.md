An end-to-end **AI-powered image segmentation and background editing tool** built using **Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM)** and integrated with **Gradio** for easy, interactive use.

This project removes image backgrounds, supports batch processing, and provides high-quality segmentation masks with visualization.  
Additionally, it proposes creative extensions using **Stable Diffusion** for background replacement, inpainting, and object editing.
